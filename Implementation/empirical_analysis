Note: We consider only 1-D dataset to empirical analysis
(This model is sensitive to its hyperparameters)

Case-I: Checking the efficiency corresponding to the number of generated samples
- As the samples increase, the covariance values decrease as the model becomes increasingly more definite.
- The objective here is to basically check if the model is updating beliefs correctly according to new data being fitted into the model

Case-II: Checking the efficiency corresponding to the hyperparameters

Case-III: Checking the efficiency corresponding to the parameters of the Gaussian Mixtures
