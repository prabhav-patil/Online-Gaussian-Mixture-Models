# Online-Gaussian-Mixture-Models
An attempt at researching and developing an online model for (adaptive) GMM.

This repository consists of various research papers and algorithms ( and their implementation ) based on on-the-fly training of Gaussian Mixture Models as a part of my Bachelor Thesis Project under Prof. Swanand Khare.

This repository is an attempt at researching and developing an ( efficient ) online algorithm that tackles the issue of a continuous online data stream into a ( gaussian-mixture ) model.

This is also an attempt to study various drawbacks and advantages of already available online algorithms which tackle this issue.
